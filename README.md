# Portfolio 

# Car Sales and Marketing

Optimized vehicle pricing strategies and inventory management by analyzing 51,525 car advertisements to identify key factors driving pricing and sales velocity. Discovered that vehicle type, model year, and condition are the primary pricing drivers, while color and condition significantly impact time-to-sale (averaging 33 days across price segments). Applied statistical analysis and data visualization to reveal pricing patterns, showing vehicles above and below $20,000 have similar average selling times but different distribution patterns. Provides dealerships actionable insights to maximize pricing while minimizing inventory holding costs and days on lot.

# Global Gaming Marketing Strategy

Built a model to predict video game success by analyzing sales, platform, and review data. Identified key factors, including top-performing genres and platforms, to optimize international marketing advertising strategies.

# Gold Mine Recovery 

This project developed a machine learning model for predicting gold recovery from ore, optimizing production processes and reducing inefficiencies. By utilizing hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, we achieved a final sMAPE of 0.983 (less than 2% error), ensuring high accuracy and reliability in the predictions.

# Lift Taxi Time

Solved driver allocation inefficiencies during peak hours by building a predictive model that forecasts taxi demand at airports. Applied time series analysis with SARIMA modeling to historical taxi order data, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy (RMSE reduced from 55 to 44). The solution accounts for seasonal patterns and hourly fluctuations to optimize driver positioning. Enables taxi companies to proactively deploy resources, reducing customer wait times and maximizing driver utilization during high-demand periods.

# Predictive Model for Minning Locations

Project to identified optimal drilling locations by analyzing geological data and evaluating risk factors. Linear regression models predicted oil production, with Geo Data 2 showing the highest production and profitability potential, offering an estimated $70M in operating profit and a 41% profit margin.

# Geospatial Data 
##### (project in work)
Earthquakes cause massive destruction, leading to thousands of deaths and billions in economic losses—like the $235 billion impact of Japan’s 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and the 230,000 deaths caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake—but predicting them remains one of the most difficult challenges in science.
