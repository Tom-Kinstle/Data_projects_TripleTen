# Portfolio 

# Car Sales and Marketing

Taking a data file of 51,525 records containing sales information of new and used vehicles (age, type, price, etc.). We clean the data to ensure each column has the correct number of values and data type. Next, start to order and group the data so we can visually recognize factors that influence price, and customer behaviors that relate to the time is takes vehicles to sell. Learning from our analysis why certain vehicle types tend to sell quicker than others. Ultimately discovering how pricing can affect consumer behaviors. We can use this knowledge to make better decisions on pricing; reducing overhead costs while maximizing profits.

# Global Gaming Marketing Strategy

Built a model to predict video game success by analyzing sales, platform, and review data. Identified key factors, including top-performing genres and platforms, to optimize international marketing advertising strategies.

# Gold Mine Recovery 

This project developed a machine learning model for predicting gold recovery from ore, optimizing production processes and reducing inefficiencies. By utilizing hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, we achieved a final sMAPE of 0.983 (less than 2% error), ensuring high accuracy and reliability in the predictions.

# Lift Taxi Time

Solved driver allocation inefficiencies during peak hours by building a predictive model that forecasts taxi demand at airports. Applied time series analysis with SARIMA modeling to historical taxi order data, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy (RMSE reduced from 55 to 44). The solution accounts for seasonal patterns and hourly fluctuations to optimize driver positioning. Enables taxi companies to proactively deploy resources, reducing customer wait times and maximizing driver utilization during high-demand periods.

# Predictive Model for Minning Locations

Project to identified optimal drilling locations by analyzing geological data and evaluating risk factors. Linear regression models predicted oil production, with Geo Data 2 showing the highest production and profitability potential, offering an estimated $70M in operating profit and a 41% profit margin.

# Geospatial Data 
##### (project in work)
Earthquakes cause massive destruction, leading to thousands of deaths and billions in economic losses—like the $235 billion impact of Japan’s 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and the 230,000 deaths caused by the 2010 Haiti earthquake—but predicting them remains one of the most difficult challenges in science.
