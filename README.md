# Car Sales and Marketing

Taking a data file of 51,525 records containing sales information of new and used vehicles (age, type, price, etc.). We clean the data to ensure each column has the correct number of values and data type. Next, start to order and group the data so we can visually recognize factors that influence price, and customer behaviors that relate to the time is takes vehicles to sell. Learning from our analysis why certain vehicle types tend to sell quicker than others. Ultimately discovering how pricing can affect consumer behaviors. We can use this knowledge to make better decisions on pricing; reducing overhead costs while maximizing profits.

# Global Gaming Marketing Strategy

Built a model to predict video game success by analyzing sales, platform, and review data. Identified key factors, including top-performing genres and platforms, to optimize international marketing advertising strategies.

# Gold Mine Recovery 

This project developed a machine learning model for predicting gold recovery from ore, optimizing production processes and reducing inefficiencies. By utilizing hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, we achieved a final sMAPE of 0.983 (less than 2% error), ensuring high accuracy and reliability in the predictions.

# Lift Taxi Time

Sweet Lift Taxi Company has gathered historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. While the data set may appear straightforward, consisting of only time and orders, various factors can influence the accuracy of time series forecasting.

# Predictive Model for Minning Locations
