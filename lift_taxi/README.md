# Lift Taxi Time 

Solved driver allocation inefficiencies during peak hours by building a predictive model that forecasts taxi demand at airports. Applied time series analysis with SARIMA modeling to historical taxi order data, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy (RMSE reduced from 55 to 44). The solution accounts for seasonal patterns and hourly fluctuations to optimize driver positioning. Enables taxi companies to proactively deploy resources, reducing customer wait times and maximizing driver utilization during high-demand periods.
