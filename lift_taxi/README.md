# Lift Taxi Time

Sweet Lift Taxi Company has gathered historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. While the data set may appear straightforward, consisting of only time and orders, various factors can influence the accuracy of time series forecasting.
