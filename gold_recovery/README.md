This project improved gold recovery rates at Zyfra’s processing plant by analyzing how different parameters in flotation and purification stages affected final output. Using correlation analysis and regression modeling, we identified key features with the strongest impact on gold yield and built predictive models with a test R² of 0.63. These models provide real-time insights to operators, enabling better control of processes and reduced gold loss. The result is improved operational efficiency and increased profitability through smarter resource recovery.
