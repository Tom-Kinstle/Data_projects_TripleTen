This project aimed to create a machine learning prototype for Zyfra to predict gold recovery from ore, optimizing production and minimizing losses. Using datasets of extraction and purification processes, we performed comprehensive data preparation, analysis, and model development.

We validated the calculation of recovery metrics, analyzed metal concentrations (Au, Ag, Pb) across purification stages, and ensured consistency between training and test datasets. We addressed anomalies in the total substance concentrations and refined the data for model reliability.

Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated using sMAPE as the performance metric. The best-performing model accurately predicted gold recovery, providing actionable insights for production optimization. This project highlighted the value of machine learning in enhancing industrial efficiency.
