# Combining Classification and Temporal Features:
 * Geopandas for Regional Data: Use geopandas to associate earthquakes with specific regions (e.g., California, specific areas of India).
 * Feature Engineering (Temporal and Non-Temporal):
   * Temporal Features: SARIMA &/or rolling mean
     * Time since the last significant earthquake in the region.
     * Number of smaller earthquakes in the region within the past month, 3 months, 6 months.
     * Rolling averages of seismic activity.
   * Non-Temporal Features:
     * Magnitude of the largest earthquake in the region's historical record.
     * Fault line characteristics (if you can obtain this data).
     * Location Data.
 * Classification Model:
   * Use a gradient boosting or random forest model to predict the probability of an earthquake exceeding your magnitude threshold within the next month.
 * Tableau Dashboard:
   * Visualize the predicted probabilities, historical earthquake data, and relevant features on your dashboard.
