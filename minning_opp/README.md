# Predictive Model for Minning Locations

Project to identified optimal drilling locations by analyzing geological data and evaluating risk factors. Linear regression models predicted oil production, with Geo Data 2 showing the highest production and profitability potential, offering an estimated $70M in operating profit and a 41% profit margin.
