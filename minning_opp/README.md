# Predictive Model for Minning Locations

Developed a predictive model to optimize oil well location selection, solving the critical business challenge of maximizing ROI on $100M drilling investments. Applied linear regression analysis across three geological regions with 100,000+ data points each to identify the most profitable drilling sites. The model successfully identified Region 2 as the optimal choice, projecting 41% profit margins and $70.6M operating profit from the top 200 well locations. This data-driven approach reduces investment risk and provides quantifiable confidence intervals for executive decision-making in resource extraction.
