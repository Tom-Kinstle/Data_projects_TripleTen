# Car Sales and Marketing

Optimized vehicle pricing strategies and inventory management by analyzing 51,525 car advertisements to identify key factors driving pricing and sales velocity. Discovered that vehicle type, model year, and condition are the primary pricing drivers, while color and condition significantly impact time-to-sale (averaging 33 days across price segments). Applied statistical analysis and data visualization to reveal pricing patterns, showing vehicles above and below $20,000 have similar average selling times but different distribution patterns. Provides dealerships actionable insights to maximize pricing while minimizing inventory holding costs and days on lot.
