# Car Sales and Marketing

Taking a data file of 51,525 records containing sales information of new and used vehicles (age, type, price, etc.). We clean the data to ensure each column has the correct number of values and data type. Next, start to order and group the data so we can visually recognize factors that influence price, and customer behaviors that relate to the time is takes vehicles to sell. Learning from our analysis why certain vehicle types tend to sell quicker than others. Ultimately discovering how pricing can affect consumer behaviors. We can use this knowledge to make better decisions on pricing; reducing overhead costs while maximizing profits.
